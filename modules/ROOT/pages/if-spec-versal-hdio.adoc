=== Versal PL HDIO

Versal PL HDIO signals are connected to the HDIO on the programmable
logic side of the Versal device and are made accessible to the
user. HDIO (High-Density I/O) includes resources supporting low-speed
SDR and DDR interfaces. These I/Os support standards compatible with
1.8 V, 2.5 V, and 3.3 V bank voltages.

The Versal device on the SC-OBC Module V1 has 22 HDIO signals, all of
which are available to the user. To use the Versal PL HDIO, the user
must supply bank power from the carrier board via VCCO_302, selecting
one of the bank voltages supported by the Versal.
