=== Versal PL XPIO

Versal PL XPIO signals connect to the XPIO on the programmable logic
side of the Versal device and are made accessible to the user. XPIO
supports both high-performance interfaces and low-speed SDR/DDR
interfaces. Using XPHY, XPIO enables data stream alignment,
serialization, and deserialization. Supported I/O standards include
bank voltages of 1.0 V, 1.2 V, 1.35 V, and 1.5 V.

The SC-OBC Module V1 provides 54 XPIO signals to the user. To use the
Versal PL XPIO, the bank power must be supplied from the carrier board
via VCCO_703, and the user can select any of the bank voltages
supported by the Versal device.
