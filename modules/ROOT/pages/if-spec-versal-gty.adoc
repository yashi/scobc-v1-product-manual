= Versal GTY/GTYP 0/1


Versal GTY/GTYP are high-speed PIPE transceivers integrated into
Versal devices. These GTY/GTYP transceivers can be connected to a PCIe
controller or a High-Speed Debug Port (HSDP).

The SC-OBC Module V1 provides users with two GTY/GTYP interfaces, each
featuring two pairs of clock signals, four pairs of transmit (TX)
signals, and four pairs of receive (RX) signals.
