= IGLOO2 MSIO 0/1

IGLOO2 MSIO 0/1 are I/O signals connected to the MSIO of the IGLOO2
device and are made accessible to the user. IGLOO2's MSIO
(Multi-Standard I/O) is a highly flexible, general-purpose I/O that
supports a wide range of I/O standards. Supported I/O standards are
bank voltages of 1.2 V, 1.5 V, 1.8 V, 2.5 V, and 3.3 V. IGLOO2 MSIO 0
provides 32 MSIO lines, while IGLOO2 MSIO 1 provides 16 MSIO lines.

To use IGLOO2 MSIO 0/1, the bank power supply must be provided from
the carrier board via M2GL_VDDI8 and M2GL_VDDI5. This allows the user
to select any bank voltage supported by IGLOO2.
