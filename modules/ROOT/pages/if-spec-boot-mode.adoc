=== Versal Boot Mode Signal

The Versal device on the SC-OBC Module V1 determines its boot method
by reading the state of the Boot Mode pin after power-up.

In normal operation, the SC-OBC Module V1 is designed to store
software in the onboard NOR flash memory and eMMC and boot from
there. However, to facilitate initial development, software can also
be stored on an SD card on the carrier board. This allows convenient
use of the SD card in development scenarios requiring frequent
software updates.

All four bits of the Boot Mode signal are wired to the board-to-board
connector, but not all combinations of these bits are supported.
