= JTAG Signals

The SC-OBC Module V1 provides JTAG signals for programming and
debugging the two onboard FPGAs. Direct access to the JTAG signals for
each FPGA is available via the 400-pin board-to-board connector.

The following table shows how the Versal and IGLOO2 JTAG signals are
assigned to each pin on the board-to-board connector. For details,
refer to SC-ESP-00086.
