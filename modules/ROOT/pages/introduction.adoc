== Introduction

The SC-OBC Module V1 is a high-performance On Board Computer designed for space missions such as Earth-orbiting satellites and lunar exploration missions (like lunar orbiters, landers and rovers).

The main processor employs the AMD Versal AI Edge Series VE2302. The AMD Versal is a high-performance device (Adaptive SoC) implementing a heterogeneous computing architecture combining Application and Real-time Processing Units, FPGAs, and AI engines. It efficiently performs preprocessing of large-scale sensor data inputs (e.g., optical sensors, SAR, LiDAR), hardware acceleration, vector operations, and storage of large-capacity data.

The SC-OBC Module V1 incorporates a Microchip IGLOO2 FPGA as a separate safety processor for system management, monitoring the operational status of the Versal.

The hardware consists of radiation-hardened devices and industrial components with confirmed high radiation tolerances, ensuring high reliability even in space environments.
